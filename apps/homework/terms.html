        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 14, 2026</p>

        <p>By using the Homework Dictation app ("the Service"), you agree to the following terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Privacy & Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your privacy and data security. This Service is designed as a "Local-First" application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Canvas Tokens:</strong> Your Canvas API Token is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. It is encrypted using a password you create.</li>
            <li><strong>Student Data:</strong> This Service does not collect, store, or process student data on our servers. All actions (creating assignments/announcements) are sent directly from your browser to Canvas via a secure proxy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Cloud Sync & Zero-Knowledge Encryption</h2>
        <p>You may optionally use our "Cloud Sync" feature to share your settings between devices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> When you sync, your data (including your Canvas Token) is <strong>encrypted on your device</strong> before being sent to the cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>We Cannot Read Your Data:</strong> Because only you hold the password to decrypt your data, Foiled By Math servers store only an unreadable "blob" of text. We cannot access your credentials or settings even if compelled to do so.</li>
            <li><strong>Password Recovery:</strong> Because we process only encrypted data, <strong>we cannot reset your password</strong>. If you lose your password, your synced data is permanently inaccessible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Newsletter & Communications (Optional)</h2>
        <p>If you choose to opt in, we collect your email address to send product updates and tips. This is optional and not required to use the Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-In Only:</strong> You must explicitly choose to join.</li>
            <li><strong>No Selling/Sharing:</strong> We will never sell or share your email address or data with anyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsubscribe Anytime:</strong> You can opt out at any time by contacting us or using an unsubscribe link in any newsletter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete your cloud backup at any time from within the app. You can also erase all locally stored settings on your device from the Settings page. You may request full deletion of any stored contact information by emailing us at support@foiledbymath.com.</p>

        <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Secure Connection password.</li>
            <li>If you lose your password, you will need to re-enter your Canvas Token, as we cannot recover encrypted data.</li>
            <li>You agree to use this Service in compliance with your school or district's Acceptable Use Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. License & Access</h2>
        <p>This Service requires a valid Access Code for use. Unauthorized distribution of Access Codes is prohibited.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. While we strive for reliability, we are not responsible for any errors in posting to Canvas or any connectivity issues.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Foiled By Math shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use this Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
